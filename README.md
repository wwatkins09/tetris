When playing this Tetris clone, users will be able to:
* Move pieces horizontally
* Rotate pieces clockwise and counterclockwise
* See the type of piece coming next

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This game will use a combination of JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 to allow for a smooth, vivid playing experience.

## Backend

As a bonus feature, this project may feature high scores and the names associated with them.

## Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Set up webpack and skeleton of overall project. Become familiar with any libraries that prove to be necessary (such as Canvas). Day 1 goals:
* Render gameplay grid
* Render tetris pieces on the screen

**Day 2**: Flesh out `piece.js` to include all possible shapes. Begin implementing horizontal and vertical motion. Goals for the day:
* Complete the `piece.js` module
* Research libraries necessary for animation
* Allow for horizontal movement of pieces

**Day 3** Finish implementing vertical movement. Implement rotation of pieces. Begin implementing logic of clearing rows/upper limit. Goals for the day:
* Allow pieces to fall, stack on top of one another.
* Rotate pieces in both directions.
* Decide on logic for clearing rows/game over.

**(Weekend)** Finish implementing all gameplay logic. Add styling for background and for game screen. Add music and, if time, high scores.
