## How to Play

### Gameplay

The player's goal is to fill as many rows as possible given the seven various types of pieces without letting them stack up to the top of the screen, or "well". Each time a row is cleared, the player earns 100 points, and the falling speed increases. Players can rotate as well as move the pieces to line them up as efficiently as possible.

### Controls

* Use the "a" and "d" keys to move the pieces left and right, or use "d" to increase the piece's falling speed.
* Turn the piece clockwise with "e" and counterclockwise with "q".
* Press "m" to mute/unmute the music.
* Press "p" to pause/restart the game.

## Future Features

* Global high scores
